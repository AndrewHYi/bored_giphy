  - "My first job as your commencement speaker is to illustrate that life is not fair. For example, you have worked tirelessly for four years to earn the diploma you'll be receiving this weekend, and Dartmouth is giving me the same degree for interviewing the fourth lead in Twilight. Deal with it. Another example that life is not fair: if it does rain, the powerful rich people on stage get the tent. Deal with it.... I've done my research. This college was named after the Second Earl of Dartmouth, a good friend of the Third Earl of UC Santa Cruz and the Duke of the Barbazon School of Beauty. Your school motto is 'Vox Clamantis in Deserto,' which means 'Voice Crying Out in the Wilderness.' This is easily the most pathetic school motto I have ever heard. Apparently, it narrowly beat out 'Silently Weeping in Thick Shrub' and 'Wimpering in Moist Leaves without Pants.' Your school color is green, and this color was chosen by Frederick Mather in 1867 because, and this is true, 'It was the only color that had not been taken already.' I cannot remember hearing anything so sad. Dartmouth, you have an inferiority complex, and you should not. You have graduated more great fictitious Americans than any other college. Meredith Grey of Grey's Anatomy. Pete Campbell from Mad Men. Michael Corleone from The Godfather. In fact, I look forward to next years' valedictory address by your esteemed classmate, Count Chocula."
